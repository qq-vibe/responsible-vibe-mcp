# Example .vibe/config.yaml
#
# This file demonstrates how to configure which workflows are available
# in your project. Place this file at .vibe/config.yaml in your project root.

# Simple allowlist of enabled workflows
enabled_workflows:
  - waterfall # Full-featured development workflow
  - epcc # Explore, Plan, Code, Commit workflow
  - bugfix # Focused bug fixing workflow
  - custom # Your custom workflow (if .vibe/workflow.yaml exists)

# Available predefined workflows:
# - waterfall: From Specification down to test â€“ the historical way
# - epcc: Explore, Plan, Code, Commit - Anthropic's methodology
# - bugfix: Reproduce, Analyze, Fix, Verify - for debugging
# - minor: Streamlined workflow for small-impact changes

# Notes:

# - Empty enabled_workflows array will cause startup to fail
# - Invalid workflow names will cause startup to fail
# - Custom workflow is only available if .vibe/workflow.yaml exists
