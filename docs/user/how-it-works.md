# How it works

This document explains how the Responsible Vibe MCP Server integrates with AI coding agents to provide structured development workflows.

## Architecture Overview

**Responsible Vibe MCP** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as an intelligent conversation coordinator for AI coding agents. It doesn't work standalone - it requires integration with an AI agent (like Claude, Amazon Q, Codex, or Gemini) that hosts the MCP server.

```

### Key Components

1. **AI Coding Agent**: Your chosen AI assistant (Claude, Amazon Q, Codex, Gemini, etc.)
2. **MCP Server**: The responsible-vibe-mcp server running as a subprocess
3. **System Prompt**: Critical configuration that tells the AI how to use the MCP tools
4. **Project Context**: Development plans, conversation state, and project artifacts

## Setup Requirement

ðŸš¨ **System prompt configuration is essential** - the AI agent needs specific instructions to interact with the MCP server properly.

**Quick Setup**: Use `npx responsible-vibe-mcp --generate-config your-agent` for automated configuration.

**Manual Setup**: Get the system prompt with `npx responsible-vibe-mcp --system-prompt` and configure your agent.

ðŸ‘‰ **For detailed setup instructions, see [Agent Setup Guide](./agent-setup.md)**

## Core Interaction Pattern

Once configured, the integration follows this pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant MCP as responsible-vibe-mcp
    participant Files as Project Files

    User->>Agent: "implement feature X"
    Agent->>MCP: whats_next(context, user_input, summary)
    MCP->>Files: Check conversation state & plan
    MCP-->>Agent: Phase-specific instructions
    Agent->>User: Follow instructions (ask questions, etc.)
    Agent->>Files: Update plan file as instructed

    Note over Agent,MCP: This loop continues throughout development

    User->>Agent: Provides more details
    Agent->>MCP: whats_next(updated context)
    MCP-->>Agent: Continue current phase or suggest transition
    Agent->>User: Continue development work
```

### Tool Usage Pattern

The AI agent automatically calls these tools based on the system prompt:

1. **`whats_next()`**: Called after each user interaction to get guidance
2. **`proceed_to_phase()`**: Called to transition between development phases
3. **`start_development()`**: Called once to begin a development workflow
4. **Other tools**: Used as needed for specific functionality

### Stateless Design

The MCP server is stateless - the AI agent provides conversation context with each tool call, and plan files serve as persistent memory across sessions.

## Phase Progression Flow

### How Users Advance Through Development Phases

After development has been started, the responsible-vibe-mcp server guides users through a structured development process using a two-tool approach that gives users full control over phase transitions:

#### 1. **Continuous Guidance with `whats_next`**

- LLM calls `whats_next()` after each user interaction
- Server analyzes current phase progress and plan file status
- Returns phase-specific instructions for what to do right now

#### 2. **Explicit Phase Transitions with `proceed_to_phase`**

- When all tasks in a phase are complete, `whats_next()` suggests moving forward
- LLM uses `proceed_to_phase()` to explicitly transition to the next phase
- User maintains full control over pacing and can choose to refine current phase

### Phase Progression Pattern

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B[LLM calls whats_next]
    B --> C{Phase Complete?}

    C -->|No| D[Continue Current Phase]
    D --> E[Follow Phase Instructions]
    E --> F[Update Plan File]
    F --> G[User Interaction]
    G --> B

    C -->|Yes| H[Suggest Phase Transition]
    H --> I{User Ready?}
    I -->|No| D
    I -->|Yes| J[LLM calls proceed_to_phase]
    J --> K[Transition to Next Phase]
    K --> B
```

### Example Phase Progression

#### Starting a New Feature

```
User: "I want to implement user authentication"
LLM: *calls whats_next()*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "New feature detected. Starting requirements analysis. Ask the user clarifying questions about WHAT they need for authentication..."
```

#### Working Within a Phase

```
LLM: *asks clarifying questions, updates plan file*
LLM: *calls whats_next()*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "Continue requirements gathering. You still need to clarify password policies and session management..."
```

#### Completing a Phase

```
LLM: *completes all requirements tasks*
LLM: *calls whats_next()*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "All requirements tasks are complete! âœ… You can proceed to design phase using 'proceed_to_phase' tool, or continue refining requirements if needed."
```

#### Transitioning to Next Phase

```
LLM: "Great! We've covered all authentication requirements. Let's move to design."
LLM: *calls proceed_to_phase(target_phase: "design", reason: "requirements complete")*
responsible-vibe-mcp: "Transitioning to design phase. Help the user design the technical solution. Ask about architecture, technologies, and quality goals..."
```

### Phase Completion Indicators

Each phase is considered complete when:

- **Requirements**: All user needs documented, scope confirmed, tasks broken down
- **Design**: Technical approach defined, architecture decided, technology choices made
- **Implementation**: Core functionality built, code structured, basic testing done
- **Quality Assurance**: Code reviewed, requirements validated, documentation complete
- **Testing**: Test plans executed, coverage verified, feature validated

### Refinement and Flexibility

Users can always choose to:

- **Stay in current phase**: Even when "complete," users can add more tasks or refine existing work
- **Go back**: Use `proceed_to_phase` to return to earlier phases if issues are discovered
- **Skip ahead**: In rare cases, jump to later phases if earlier work is already done

This approach ensures users maintain full control over the development process while receiving structured guidance from responsible-vibe-mcp.

    end
```

LLM: "Let's implement this step by step:

**Step 1: Backend Setup**
First, let's set up the user model and authentication middleware...

  password_hash: { type: String, required: true },
  name: { type: String, required: true },

## Development Workflow Examples

### Starting Development

Development must be explicitly initiated using the `start_development` tool, which allows users to select their preferred workflow:

```

start_development({ workflow: "your-preferred-workflow" })

````

Available workflows include various built-in options and custom workflows defined in `.vibe/workflow.yaml`.

> **Important**: The `start_development` tool must be called before any other tools (`whats_next`, `proceed_to_phase`, `resume_workflow`). This ensures that development follows a deliberate workflow selection process.

### Workflow-Agnostic Examples

#### Basic Feature Development
```javascript
// Start development with any workflow
start_development({ workflow: "feature-workflow" })

// LLM calls after each user interaction
whats_next({
  context: "user wants to add new feature",
  user_input: "implement feature X",
  conversation_summary: "Working on feature X implementation"
})

// When phase is complete, transition explicitly
proceed_to_phase({
  target_phase: "next-phase",
  reason: "current phase tasks completed"
})
````

#### Bug Fix Development

```javascript
// Start with bug-focused workflow
start_development({ workflow: 'bugfix-workflow' });

// Continuous guidance through bug resolution
whats_next({
  context: 'investigating reported bug',
  user_input: 'users report login fails',
  conversation_summary: 'Debugging login failure issue',
});
```

#### Custom Workflow Development

```javascript
// Use custom workflow definition
start_development({ workflow: 'custom' });

// Follow custom phase progression
proceed_to_phase({
  target_phase: 'custom-phase-name',
  reason: 'ready for custom workflow step',
});
```
