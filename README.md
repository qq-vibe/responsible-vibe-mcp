An intelligent conversation coordinator for AI coding agents that provides structured development workflows through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## What is Responsible Vibe MCP?

**Responsible Vibe MCP** transforms your AI coding agent into a structured development partner that:

- **Guides Development Workflows**: Takes you through proven development phases (requirements â†’ design â†’ implementation â†’ testing)
- **Maintains Project Memory**: Keeps track of decisions, progress, and context across conversations
- **Provides Phase-Specific Guidance**: Tells your AI exactly what to focus on at each development stage
- **Manages Project Documentation**: Creates and maintains architecture, requirements, and design documents

## Quick Start

### ðŸš€ **1-Command Setup**

Choose your AI coding agent and run the setup command:

```bash
# For Amazon Q CLI
npx responsible-vibe-mcp --generate-config amazonq-cli

# For Claude Code
npx responsible-vibe-mcp --generate-config claude

# For Codex CLI
npx responsible-vibe-mcp --generate-config codex

# For Gemini CLI
npx responsible-vibe-mcp --generate-config gemini
```

This automatically creates all necessary configuration files with the correct system prompt and MCP server settings.

### âœ… **Verify Setup**

Start a conversation with your AI agent and ask:

> "Help me implement a new feature"

Your agent should automatically call MCP tools and guide you through a structured development process.

## How It Works

```

1. **You interact** with your AI coding agent normally
2. **AI agent calls** responsible-vibe-mcp tools automatically (via system prompt)
3. **MCP server provides** phase-specific guidance and maintains project context
4. **Development progresses** through structured workflows with persistent memory

## Example Development Flow

```
You: "I need user authentication for my app"

AI Agent: *calls whats_next() automatically*
â†“
MCP Server: "Start requirements phase. Ask about auth type, user data, security needs..."
â†“
AI Agent: "Let me understand your requirements:
1. What type of authentication? (email/password, social login, etc.)
2. What user information do you need to store?
3. Any specific security requirements?"

[Conversation continues through requirements â†’ design â†’ implementation â†’ testing]
```

## Available Workflows

- **waterfall**: Full-featured development (requirements â†’ design â†’ implementation â†’ QA â†’ testing)
- **epcc**: Explore â†’ Plan â†’ Code â†’ Commit (Anthropic's methodology)
- **bugfix**: Reproduce â†’ Analyze â†’ Fix â†’ Verify
- **minor**: Streamlined for small changes
- **greenfield**: New projects from scratch
- **custom**: Define your own in `.vibe/workflow.yaml`

## Key Features

- **ðŸ§  Long-Term Memory**: Project context survives across conversations and restarts
- **ðŸ“‹ Structured Workflows**: Proven development methodologies built-in
- **ðŸ“š Smart Documentation**: Auto-generates and maintains project docs
- **ðŸ”„ Phase Transitions**: Clear progression through development stages
- **ðŸŽ¯ Contextual Guidance**: AI gets specific instructions for each phase
- **ðŸ”§ Git Integration**: Optional automatic commits with configurable behavior
- **ðŸ‘¥ Review System**: Optional quality gates before phase transitions

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18.0.0+**
- **AI Coding Agent** (Amazon Q, Claude, Codex, Gemini, etc.)
- **Git repository** (optional, for commit features)

## Manual Setup

If you prefer manual configuration:

### 1. Get System Prompt

```bash
npx responsible-vibe-mcp --system-prompt
```

### 2. Configure Your AI Agent

Add the system prompt to your AI agent's configuration.

### 3. Add MCP Server

Configure your agent to connect to `npx responsible-vibe-mcp`.

## Troubleshooting

**Agent doesn't call MCP tools?**

- Verify system prompt is configured correctly
- Check MCP server connection in agent settings

**"Tool not found" errors?**

- Ensure `npx responsible-vibe-mcp` runs successfully
- Restart your agent/IDE after configuration

**Need help?**

- Check the [troubleshooting guide](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/user/agent-setup.html#troubleshooting)
- Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
